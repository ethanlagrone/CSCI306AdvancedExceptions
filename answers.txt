What are 3 good practices related to exception handling?

1) Always be specific. Don't throw "Exception", don't catch "Exception", and definitely
don't catch "Throwable".

2) Think through whether you want your custom exceptions to be checked or unchecked.
Checked exceptions extend Exception and must be handled with try/catch clauses in order 
for a program to compile. Unchecked exceptions extend RuntimeException and are not 
handled by try/catch clauses. They usually represent fatal errors that cannot be fixed
such as NullPointerException. It is important to make thoughtful choices when deciding
which you want your custom exceptions to be.

3) Don't swallow exceptions. Empty catch blocks or ones that only contain "return null;"
leave you no way of telling what the original exception was.
